# Prediciting-Undergraduate-Students-Midsemester-Housing-Trasnfers-At-Oklahoma-State-University

The project started of as a pet project, working on the data gathered for frehsmen students at Oklahoma State University, I am looking to create profiles of students using data from multiple sources, including their academics, conduct, care and housing data. The aim is to then classify the students as high risk or low risk, based on their affinity to leave on campus housing, mid semester of on-campus transfers causes a lot of pressure on the resendential life system and leads to underutliziation of resources allocated, **I will be presenting my work in 2 confenrences in February, the modeling and recommendations are not fully completed as the project is still in progress but below is the abstract submitted to the conferences.**


## ABSTRACT

Mid-semester transfers and room cancellations pose significant challenges for many universities, extending beyond the financial implications of upkeep and maintenance to the substantial loss of housing resources for an entire semester. Our ongoing research focuses specifically on addressing this concern within the context of undergraduate housing at Oklahoma State University (OSU). Our project centers on the development of a sophisticated predictive model that harnesses a spectrum of student data. This includes academic performance metrics, levels of engagement in on-campus housing and university events, records of conduct cases, and the outcomes of intentional conversations. Our primary goal is to anticipate mid-semester transfer-outs and evaluate the likelihood of students transitioning to off-campus housing alternatives. A pivotal aspect of our study revolves around examining the impact of different housing styles, comparing traditional setups to suite-style accommodations. We delve into various variables that contribute to a student's perception of on-campus housing and how these factors correlate with their decision to relocate. To accomplish this, we draw data from diverse campus sources, incorporating information from platforms like Maxient, Starrez, and Roompact. These sources enable us to create comprehensive profiles for individual students, facilitating the classification of students based on their associated risks of leaving university housing. Our endeavor is not solely analytical; it's geared toward offering actionable recommendations. We aim to support OSU's housing strategies by providing insights that optimize resource allocation and mitigate the costs associated with underutilized rooms. Ultimately, our research seeks to enhance the university's ability to adapt its housing policies, fostering a more robust and responsive residential environment for its students.
